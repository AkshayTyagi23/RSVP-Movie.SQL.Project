# RSVP-Movie.SQL.Project
Analyzed IMDb data to identify genre trends, top studios, and key filmmakers. Recommended Drama as the priority genre and strategic collaborations with major studios for RSVP Movies' future projects.
The analysis of the IMDb dataset reveals key insights for RSVP Movies' strategic planning. There is a noticeable decline in movie production over the years, with March being the peak month. Drama stands out as the most popular genre, with 4285 films and an average duration of 106.77 minutes; notably, 1078 drama films were produced in 2019. For future projects, RSVP
should prioritize Drama, while also considering Action and Thriller genres. Dream Warrior Pictures and National Theatre Live are recognized for their high number of hit movies, making
them strong production partners. Noteworthy films include 'Kirket' and 'Love in Kilnerry,' both rated 10, with 'Gini Helida Kathe' and 'Runam' following closely. Marvel Studios, Twentieth Century Fox, and Warner Bros are leading in global reach based on movie votes, suggesting potential collaborations. Star Cinema and Twentieth Century Fox excel in multilingual hits, making them suitable for global projects. James Mangold is the top director for high-impact genres, while Mammootty and Mohanlal are top actors by median rating. For drama, consider Parvathy Thiruvothu and Andrew Garfield. Vijay Sethupathi and Taapsee Pannu are recommended for Indian and Hindi films, respectively, based on their performance metrics.
